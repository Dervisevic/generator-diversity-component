Diversity component generator
=======================
A yeoman generator for starting a new component for [Diversity]('https://diversity.io/').

Usage
-----------------------
First install yeoman and the generator:
 * `npm install -g yo generator-diversity-component`


Then just run:
 * `yo diversity-component`

___________________

You can create the project directory on your own and `cd` inside it. Or just run the generator where you want the project directory.

**Component name**

Project folder is always param-cased (ex. `component-name`). However if you let the generator create the project folder for you then the component name can be formatted how you want, the generator will reformat the string anyway.
